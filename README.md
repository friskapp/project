[Frisk](https://frisk.app) is an affordable & privacy-focused **self-hosted** Laravel error tracking solution


## Frisk's Features
- Privacy; because it's self-hosted. Your errors & logs are safe in your hands not others.
- Privacy; because your team information and identities are not recorded with thousands of others.
- Privacy; because code snippets you share are shared by you and hosted by you.
- Unlimited everything; you don't have to upgrade to a different plan to just add another member to a team! or to get an error that happens a year ago because of the retention limits! you host it .. you control it.
- Customization Freedom; you can change, edit or add features because you are (and I bet on that) a developer and developers can't use a thing without tinkering with it :).

To be able to install this, you need a Frisk license that you can buy at frisk.app
